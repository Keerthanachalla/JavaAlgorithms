Dear there,

   This is my repo about the implemention of essential data structures and algorithms in Java. Even though I learned DSA three years ago, I still think I do not grasp it well. So, I prefer to use this chance to strengthen my programming skills with the Java language.

* Data Structures
** Linked List
** Stack
** Queue
** Tree
- Print Left View of a given binary tree
** Heap
** Graph
* Algorithms
** Number Theory
** Binary Search

** Graphs
- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Floyd Warshall
- Minimum Spanning Tree
  + Kruskal's MST
  + Prim's MST
- Maximum Flow
- Lowest Common Ancestor

** Dynamic Programming
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Edit Distance
** Divide and Conquer
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
** Misc
- Binary Indexed Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Hashing
- Bit Algorithms
- String Algorithms
  + KMP
