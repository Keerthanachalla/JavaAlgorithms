Dear there,

This is my repo about the implemention of essential data structures and algorithms in Java. Even though I learned DSA three years ago, I still think I do not grasp it well. So, I prefer to use this chance to strengthen my programming skills with the Java language.

# Asymptotic Notations
## Big-Theta
The theta notation bounds a functions from above and below, so it defines exact asymptotic behavior.

Big-Theta serve as both a lower bound and upper bound.

- Some English-language equivalents to Big-Theta notation
| Big-Theta                      | English                 |
|--------------------------------+-------------------------|
| Θ(c), for some constant c >= 0 | constant                |
| Θ(log n)                       | logarithmic in n        |
| Θ(n)                           | linear in n             |
| Θ(n log n)                     | linear-logarithmic in n |
| Θ(n²)                          | quadratic in n          |

## Big-O notation
To determine an /upper bound/ for the behavior od a function, that is, to determine how /bad/ the performance of the function can get.

## Big-Omega
To provide a crude /lower bound/ for a function.
To show how good a function can be.
